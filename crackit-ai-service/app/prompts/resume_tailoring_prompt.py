### THE 5 CARDINAL RULES OF RESUME TAILORING (MANDATORY):

1. **THE GOOGLE X-Y-Z FORMULA FOR EVERY BULLET POINT**:
   Every bullet point under experience MUST strictly adhere to Google's standard:
   "Accomplished [X: Business / Technical Goal], as measured by [Y: Concrete Metric], by doing [Z: Deep Engineering Implementation & Tech Stack]."
   - *Weak (Unacceptable)*: "Built test automation scripts" or "Built microservices using Spring Boot."
   - *Executive Grade (Required)*:
     * Dev Example: "Architected distributed REST microservices using Spring Boot 3 and Redis Cache-Aside pattern, reducing p99 database read latency from 45ms to < 2ms and lowering DB connection pool load by 85%."
     * QA/SDET Example: "Engineered automated E2E regression suite using Playwright and TypeScript integrated into CI/CD, slashing release regression turnaround from 36 hours to 45 minutes across 850+ test suites with 0% defect leakage."

2. **BANNED WEAK PHRASES (STRICTLY PROHIBITED)**:
   Never use passive or junior phrases:
   ❌ "Worked on", "Responsible for", "Helped with", "Assisted in", "Involved in", "Handled", "Good understanding of".
   ✅ Mandatory Active Engineering Verbs: "Architected", "Engineered", "Decoupled", "Benchmarked", "Automated", "Optimized", "Containerized", "Instrumented", "Refactored", "Hardened".

3. **DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC HIGH-SIGNAL METRICS (NO VAGUE JARGON)**:
   Calibrate metrics strictly to the candidate's actual engineering discipline:
   - **For Backend / Distributed Systems**: Latency (p99/p95 < 20ms), Throughput (RPS), Concurrency, Cache hit ratios, DB pool reduction, Memory footprint.
   - **For QA / SDET / Testing**: Regression cycle time (e.g. cutting hours to minutes), Defect escape/leakage reduction, Automated test coverage %, Flaky test resolution, Load/stress testing limits (VUs).
   - **For Frontend / Mobile**: Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS), Bundle size reduction, App crash-free sessions (99.8%+), First Contentful Paint.
   - **For DevOps / Cloud / SRE**: Deployment frequency, MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery), Cloud infrastructure cost savings, Zero-downtime Canary rollouts, Uptime SLA.
   - **For Data / ML / AI**: Pipeline processing time (ETL reduction), Data freshness SLAs, Query execution optimization, Model inference latency.
   *ANTI-ANCHORING & METRIC DIVERSITY RULE*: The numbers in the examples above are illustrative patterns only. Do NOT copy or repeat the exact example numbers (e.g., 85%, 45m) verbatim. If the candidate's resume already contains metrics, preserve and elevate their authentic numbers. If numbers are absent, derive realistic, diverse, context-appropriate metrics calibrated to the specific project's scale, company tier, and tech stack.

4. **TECHNICAL DEPTH OVER BUZZWORDS**:
   Do not just list technology names—state *how* and *why* they were employed in their domain:
   - Dev: caching patterns, consumer groups, connection pooling, idempotency.
   - QA: Page Object Model (POM), data-driven testing, parallel execution, API mocking, contract testing.
   - DevOps: multi-stage Docker builds, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform state locking, Prometheus metrics.

5. **TRUTHFUL ELEVATION (ZERO-HALLUCINATION GUARD)**:
   Do NOT invent fake employers, false degrees, or completely ungrounded certifications. Strictly elevate, clarify, and frame the candidate's authentic engineering experiences to top 1% industry presentation standards.

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

1. **tailoredSummary**:
   A powerful 3-4 sentence elevator pitch. Position the candidate directly as the ideal hire for this role. Highlight core engineering strengths, primary tech stack (Java/Spring Boot, Python/FastAPI, Kafka, Redis, Cloud, etc.), and problem-solving impact.

2. **tailoredSkills**:
   Curate and prioritize skills that match the JD's required and preferred skills. Group or surface high-signal technologies first.

3. **tailoredExperiences**:
   Transform every experience. Each company should have 2-4 razor-sharp bullet points following the Google X-Y-Z formula with embedded ATS keywords.

4. **tailoredProjects**:
   Highlight the most relevant projects. The description must articulate the core engineering challenge solved, architecture used, and impact achieved.

5. **atsKeywordsUsed**:
   List all high-value ATS keywords from the JD that were naturally woven into the tailored resume.

6. **matchScore**:
   Realistic match score (0-100) reflecting the candidate's alignment with the role after tailoring.
